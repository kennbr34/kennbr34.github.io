<H3>YAXA Stream Cipher</H3>

YAXA (Yet Another XOR Algorithm) is so named because it is intended to form only the most rudimentary stream cipher akin to the &quot;Simple XOR&quot; approach, without any intent to be &quot;unbreakable&quot; or stronger than any other established algorithm.  The entire goal is to form the simplest encryption, but with the strongest security at that limited complexity level.  It is not intended to keep information secret for long periods of time, but rather to protect plain-text data written to temporary files.

<br>

</DL>

<P>

The YAXA key derivation function ( not diagrammed here) uses a 128-bit <B>Initialization Vector</B> <B>(nonce)</B> from a 64-byte salt used for OpenSSL, and uses PBKDF2 to generate a pseudo-random 8192 bit (or 1024 byte) key array <B>(K₁-₁₀₂₄)</B>.  The iteration amount of PBKDF2 is based upon the length of the user supplied password of which the key <B>(K)</B> is being derived, multiplied by a factor of 1000 (as recommended in RFC 2898), and added with a byte of the 128-bit salt,  so the iteration amount of PBKDF is <B>password-length *  1000 + nonce-byte</B>.  The SHA512 hashing algorithm is then used to generate 16 different arrays of 64 CSPRNG bytes, concatenated into a buffer to form the 1024-byte key array. The salt is then used with PBKDF2 to create <B>N</B> which is a 512-bit (64-byte) nonce XOR'd between the message byte and keystream byte. Note that <B>N</B> and <B>K</B> have an upper bound of 64 ( <B>Nₙ</B> will be N++ % 64) and 1024 respectively, but <B>KS</B> will be generated to be as long as the message text.
<P>
The counter variable <B>(KC)</B> is initialized to 1 and used in a keycounter generator <B>(g)</B>, where it is merely incremented sequentially.  The decryption routine is the inverse of the encryption function <B>(E)</B>.  The use of the <B>IV</B>, counter variable <B>(KC)</B>, counter function <B>(g)</B> and key stream generator <B>(f)</B> forms a very rudimentary <B>counter-based stream cipher</B> (Aumasson).
<P>
As the encryption function<B>(E)</B> is incrementally applied to each byte in the message text <B>(P₁-₁₀₂₅)</B>, the key counter variable <B>(KC)</B> is updated in such fashion that it will not impart repeating patterns from the keystream <B>(KS₁-₁₀₂₅)</B> into the ciphertext <B>(C₁-₁₀₂₅)</B> like a running-key would, as happens when key byte<B>(K₁₀₂₄)</B> becomes key byte <B>(K₁)</B> again when the key array <B>(K₁-₁₀₂₄)</B> bounds are reached; the 512-bit nonce similarly repeats after reaching its 64-byte bounds.
<P>
Finally, the keystream <B>(KS₁-₁₀₂₅)</B> creates a non-periodic key to span the message length <B>(P₁-₁₀₂₅)</B> which creates the 'one-time-pad'.  The program updates the salts used for IV/nonce generation upon every database update to avoid nonce reuse.

<H3>YAXA Implementation Flaw</H3>

<P>
The key counter variable is declared as an integer, but returned from the YAXA encryption operation as a char.  This reduces
its overall size from 2^32 bytes, to just 255, which means the algorithm above would have induced a period in the
keystream at a very short interval of 1024 bytes.

the incrementation of keyStreamGenByte via keyStreamGenByte++ fulfills keycounter function g()

</DL>
If the iterator used to index yaxaKey array elements is only 1023 then the kystream repeats
every 1024 bytes.  The iterator must be allowed to index yaxaKey[1024]. An extra byte is allocated and derived for
this purpose to avoid undefined behavior of addressing yaxaKey[1024] if only allocated to 1024 bytes. This does not solve
the problem but it increases the period size to ~3.4 megabytes.  Since the password entries are padded in 1024 bytes of data,
this means that the password file can still contain 3331 password entires before the keystream becomes periodic.

with 1025 byte key buffer and 65 byte nonce buffer the keystream still becomes periodic after 3411200 byte

<H3>Security of YAXA</H3>

<P>
Even without the implementation flaw, YAXA is still almost certainly vulnerable to some other form of cryptanalysis with the simple relations in the YAXA keystream generator<B>(g)</B> and function<B>(f)</B> (only a ximple XOR of <B>KC</B> against <B>K</B>, and <B>KC</B> merely being incremented ). A skilled cryptanalysis would likely find an exploitable vulnerability, even if the algorithm were programmed correctly. Standardized KDFs and CSPRNGs were used in hopes of avoiding determinism and bias, and tests were performed with dieharder and NIST STS to ensure the ciphter-text was indistingushable from pseudorandomness, but this relies on the pseudorandom input padding once the data set being encrypted goes beyond 3.4 MB. But that is the most that can be said for YAXA's strength.
<P>
However that's not to say that an cryptanalysis is inevitable, or even at all likely. An attack based on such cryptanalysis would be the least practical attack against this implementation. The exposure of YAXA data to be cryptanalyzed could only come about through conditions which imply a host of other conditions which would make things like keyloggers a more likely angle of attack. If an attacker had the resources and/or access required to get access to the YAXA data at all (breaking the cascaded encryption, forensic recovery, or man-in-the-middle type attacks), then they can find easier ways than cryptanalysis of YAXA to reveal the secrets (or gain access to whatever secrets those passwords are meant to protect).
